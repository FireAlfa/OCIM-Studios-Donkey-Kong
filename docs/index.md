## Our project 

This is our recreation of the classic 1981 Donkey Kong arcade videogame. The game was developed by 4 studens of CITM "Game Design and Development" degree, during the "Project 1" subject.

## About the game

Donkey Kong is an arcade game from the platform genre released on July 9th, 1981 by Nintendo, later it was ported to the Famicom on July 15th, 1983 in Japan, and it didn't arrive in Europe and North America until 1986. The game introduces you to Jumpman, the main character, who will later become in Mario, the well known plumber. Jumpman has to reach the Lady, who will later be named as Pauline, while dodging objects that Donkey Kong throws at him. Jumpman has some power-ups that can help him in the rescue.
